                The purpose of this web app is to manage, calculate and display employees payroll and scheduling activities. 
                Both employer and employee will be able to see the rostering schedules of the week, and total pay of the working week 
                and send documents to each other as needed. Hence, it makes it easier for the employer and employee to understand their 
                rosters and prevent miscommunication.

                EasyPortal seeks to solve how these issues can impact smaller businesses, where these responsibilities often fall to 
                only one or two people and can be very time consuming. Owners or managers of these businesses need an easy-to-use system 
                to help reduce time tied up with administrative duties. Employees of these businesses can also benefit from more direct 
                communication and less confusing information about important factors such as rostered shifts and pays.

                This application is being developed in response to the issue raised by the client, a local gym that is a small business 
                run by a single owner. As an individual running a small business, the gym owner was keen to reduce time needed to spend 
                on business administration tasks and reduce the chance of miscommunication with employees. The primary focus of the 
                project will be to have a rostering function and provide pay information, two areas that the client struggles with. 
                EasyPortal is being developed to include this, but also with the scope to introduce new features over time to 
                continue to provide functionality for the client.
